Buddy is a wonderful companion who has quickly become a favorite at our shelter. He has a sunny disposition and gets along well with children and other dogs. However, he's not a fan of cats, so a cat-free home would be ideal for him. Buddy is vaccinated, neutered, and has no special needs, making him ready for his new family. If you're looking for a loyal friend to add to your family, Buddy might just be your perfect match!

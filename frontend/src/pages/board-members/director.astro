        bio="A NYC native by way of Baltimore, Peter’s friends wonder how a city kid (kid? Hah!) could reside on rural New Mexico ranch-land after all the years of frenetic pace in gotham… to which he patiently explains that it’s actually quite a natural and welcome fit. Savoring the quiet and gentle pace, among many other things, he can regularly be found walking with his Border Collie along the county roads near his home, working at his homestead or gauzily daydreaming in the studio. Peter came to the Friends of the Mountainair Animal Shelter a few years ago thru casual conversation with a fellow NYer and FOMAS volunteer (“that accent sounds like NY” we asked each other - thx trish!). While the caring and caretaking at FOMAS Is a natural extension of his life long love of and companionship with dogs, he feels that “our” dogs give more back to him than it seems he could possibly give to them. But, nonetheless, he endeavors to keep trying to do so. When not helping at FOMAS, Peter paints large pictures, investigates the possibilities of building scale and geo size constructions as well as pausing in appreciation of the calming majesty and the grandiose magnificence of New Mexico and around the southwest."

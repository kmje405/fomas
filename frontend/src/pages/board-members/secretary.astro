        bio="Philip grew up in a military family and crisscrossed the country as they moved from one duty station to another. His father bread field trial champion Britney Spaniels so, there was always 8 to 10 dogs around the house, not to mention his sisters cats and stray dogs she brought home and the occasional family horse. In 2021, Philip retired from a 30 year career in commercial design and construction in Seattle WA and settled in Mountainair NM. Not long after, Philip joined the shelter as a volunteer dog walker and has since joined the board of directors and has taken on administrative duties to help support the members of the board and volunteers. Dobby, a recent addition to the family, is quickly becoming a world traveler and the perfect side kick."

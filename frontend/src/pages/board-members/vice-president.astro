    bio="Ever since receiving her first chihuahua puppy when she was six-months old, Karen has surrounded herself with a variety of “fur-babies.” Equine, bovine, canine, feline and even swine! This includes Pierre the pot-bollied pig, Billy the goat, birds, hermit crabs and chickens! With the help of her husband, Mountainair Animal Shelter’s animal control officer Steve Bernauer, Karen has dedicated a good portion of her time to ensure that the dogs of MAS have a great quality of life. She also brilliantly coordinates all of FOMAS’ mobile spay-neuter clinics, helping people from all over Torrance County have access to this much needed service. Contact: woof@fomas.org"

## FOMAS Projects and Initiatives

While FOMAS has accomplished a great deal in only two-and-a-half years, there are many more projects either underway or in the planning stages. Take a look at what’s up our sleeves!

## Mobile Spay/Neuter Clinics

Since 2018, we have been working with Bro and Tracy Animal Welfare’s mobile spay/neuter clinic. The clinic has visited Mountainair and Torrance County to provide low cost spay and neutering services for dogs and cats. We would like to keep providing this service to our community and help cover the cost of those pets who need to be spayed and neutered. As of now, the Bro and Tracy S/N Clinic has fixed close to 200 animals in Torrance County! This effort helps keep unwanted dogs and cats from reproducing and ending up in our shelters.

In addition to offering the mobile clinic, plans are underway to establish a fund to help those who cannot afford to have their pets fixed.

## Fence Program

One of our main goals is to support our citizens to be able to keep their dogs safely and healthily at home. We receive many stray dogs that have escaped their yards or who have broken away from being tied out (which is still legal in some parts of New Mexico.) The proposed fencing program would offer a safe alternative to keep pets safe at home by providing fenced-in yards.

Fencing can be expensive, and with the help of donated funds, grants, and volunteer labor, FOMAS will help to patch fences, build fences, or donate a dog run to those that are in need of such services.

## Humane Education

Providing services such as spay and neuter or building fences is important, but FOMAS also believes in the importance of humane education. We are working on programs that will bring humane education to our community’s children. This would involve volunteers working with groups of children through the schools or civic organizations such as the Girl or Boy Scouts. Humane education includes understanding basic pet care and the importance of spaying and neutering animals. As we broaden our scope, we want to offer opportunities such as a “pet camp” for kids to come to the shelter and “volunteer” for a week. This early education about the joys and sorrows of shelter life will help them develop empathy, teamwork, and confidence as they see how their love and efforts have a direct impact on a dog in need.

FOMAS raised over $11,000 during the summer of 2020 to rebuild the dilapidated outdoor kennel structures. Originally built in 2012, the kennels were falling apart and in some places, even dangerous. With the construction expertise of Animal Control Officer Steve Bernauer and the fundraising skills of volunteers, the old kennels were demolished and rebuilt. The new kennels have been greatly improved for sanitation and our dogs are now safe and secure within them.

                Every dog that comes through the doors of the Mountainair Animal
                Shelter receives more individualized attention than at other, larger
                shelters. We do not euthanize at our shelter, so if a dog comes in
                with serious behavioral or medical issues, we do everything in our
                capacity to address those needs, AND we have been 97% successful in
                these efforts, placing those dogs in permanent homes. Our volunteers
                have single-handedly rescued dozens of dogs from high-kill shelters,
                rehabilitated them for medical problems or emotional stress and gotten
                them adopted into loving homes. We believe there is a permanent home
                for every single dog.
